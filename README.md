First of all clone this project into your system.
And using VScode or others you can run using npm start .
And  you can see database connected.
Then open chrome and search localhost3000
If you have to put products to cart ,login first.
when you have to add products go to admin side by searching localhost3000/admin.
when cart is active you can buy products by payment of razorpay.

This is my e-commerce project to show my skill and it is an incomplete project . I wish you can help me to complete this by contributing and make suggestions through my email www.muhdmuthz7@gmail.com
